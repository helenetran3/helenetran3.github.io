    <p>My name is H√©l√®ne Tran, and I am currently a Ph.D candidate in Automatic Emotion Recognition, attached to LIMOS computer science
    laboratory and to Jeolis Solutions digital services company.</p>

    fulfilled in my life. <br>
    Moreover, I aim to dedicate my life in improving others' life through my professional career and my positivity. I have a great interest in 
    psychology, and more specifically emotional intelligence. I nourish my knowledge through social interactions as well as readings. </p>
