    <p>Hello dear reader, welcome to my personal page! üåª</p>

    <p>My name is H√©l√®ne Tran, and I am currently a <b>first year Ph.D candidate in Automatic Emotion Recognition</b>, attached to LIMOS computer science laboratory and to Jeolis Solutions digital services company, both in Clermont-Ferrand, France.</p>
    
    <p>I keep being in search of new and exciting challenges to gain professional and personal experiences: this is my secret key to feeling
    fulfilled in my life. Humanitarian trip, tutoring, study abroad, now doing a 3-year research in two fields that I love (Artificial Intelligence and Psychology),
    and many more experiences to come! </p>

    <p>Moreover, I aim to dedicate my life in improving others' life through my professional career and my positivity. I have a great interest in 
    psychology, and more specifically in emotional intelligence, thus I cultivate my openness of mind by nourishing my thoughts through social interactions 
    and readings. I have travelled in many countries, including Nepal (humanitarian trip) and Australia (one and a half year study), where I met different cultures and learned from them. </p>
    
    <p>This website is intended to share my knowledge and experiences with you. I hope you will enjoy navigating in it! </p>
    
    <p>Enjoy your visit and have a great day! ‚òÄÔ∏è</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    
    <p>After obtaining the scientific Baccalaur√©at with <i>Very Good</i> distinction in France, I studied an intensive two-year class in <b>Mathematics</b> and Physics in order to prepare national competitive exams for Engineering Schools. </p><p> I successfully entered one of the top Engineering Schools specialised in Computer Science and Mathematics (ENSIIE, for <i>√âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Informatique pour l'Industrie et l'Entreprise</i>). I gained technical skills in <b>Programming</b> and <b>Project Management</b>, along with expanding my knowledge in Mathematics. </p><p>While I was preparing a specialisation in Software Engineering, I was introduced to <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>, thus I decided to do a double degree in Australia in this field. For a year and a half, I enjoyed studying the techniques used in Artificial Intelligence and reflecting on the possibilities it offers to society. </p><p>All my professional experiences that followed have been aimed at <b>using Artificial Intelligence to improve the well-being of our society</b>: developing an open-source software for radiotherapy research (OnkoDICOM), performing the classification of prostate cancer tumours and now creating a robust automatic emotion recognition system for mental state estimation  (see Projects for more details). </p>
