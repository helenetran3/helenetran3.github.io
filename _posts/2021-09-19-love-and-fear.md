In my opinion, the opposite of love is neither hate nor indifference but fear.

Love brings us together while fear separates us.


There are two types of fear. 

The first is the fear that I would say cerebral: it is created by the imagination when we are facing the unknown. It comes from pressures regarding one's own expectations or those of society. For example, "I am afraid of not being good enough", "I am afraid of being judged". In this case, one must be able to identify it, admit it and dare to face it through action. ðŸ’¥

The second is instinctive fear. This is the primary function of this emotion, as it allows us to protect our physical and mental integrity. Unlike cerebral fear, it is useful: we feel it in our gut and it clearly indicates a danger. Either this danger is obvious (aggression in the street for example) or more subtle (psychological hold). When we feel this type of fear, we must listen to it and take it into consideration. ðŸŒ±


In contrast, love cherishes the difference and autonomy of the other. It is at the heart of our humanity. It allows us to be as we are and I will prove it to you with my personal example.


This year, when I was going through a very difficult time personally, to the point of doubting my own identity, I could have stayed alone with my fear that I would never make it. 

Instead, I dared to ask for help. And every time I asked, I was welcomed with open arms.

I realized that I was surrounded by a lot of love thanks to each and every one of my friends, thanks to my family, thanks to my supervisors, my office mates and my fellow PhD mates.

And what gave me the strength to fight today, better than ever, was love.

So to all those who have reached out to me, thank you.

Now, thanks to love, I feel completely fulfilled in my life. I am passionate about my thesis on automatic emotion recognition, I practice taekwondo, I participate in public speaking and theater associations, I cherish the time I spend with myself, and I plan to resume volunteering.

And most importantly, I cultivate my love of self.


I wish you, reader, to be surrounded by lots of love and most importantly, to love yourself as you are. If you need to talk, feel free to send me a private message ðŸ˜Š

With love ðŸ’–
