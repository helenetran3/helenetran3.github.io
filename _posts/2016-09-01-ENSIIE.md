Completed Engineering Degree majoring in Software Engineering.

Solid background in **mathematics**, **computer science** and **project management**.  

The first two years (Sep 2016 - Jun 2018) were mostly to learn the basics of programming (C, C++, Java, Python) and core concepts of Software Engineering. 

The third year (Jul 2018 - Dec 2019) is completed through a double degree in Artificial Intelligence in the University of Wollongong (Australia). 

My final research internship on Prostate Cancer Tumor Classification was done from February to August 2020 to complete my Engineering Degree in ENSIIE.
