Purpose
: **Develop an automatic emotion recognition system**, based on signals from *visual, vocal* and *textual* modalities. This research work comes with its own challenges, notably with the fusion of heterogeneous and high dimensional data, as well as the management of contradictory information.

Context (as part of *Jeolis Solutions* company projects)
: 
- **Estimate the emotional state** from a video support to improve a patient monitoring software developed by the company. This is to help health professionals to remotely have an insight of their mental health and prevent possible relapse risks (which is essential for patients suffering from a chronic or mental pathology).
- **Adapting software content for a motivational purpose**: personalised physical activity coaching.

Current tasks performed
: 
- Literature review on emotion recognition models and emotion psychology
- Reflection on the application cases of the thesis
- Research paper writing
- Weekly meeting with the laboratory and the company teams
