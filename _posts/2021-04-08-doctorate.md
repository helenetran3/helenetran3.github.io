Jeolis Solutions focuses part of its activities on the design of software solutions for the management and monitoring of patients. They now want to estimate their emotional state and correlate it with their answers to protocolised questionnaires. This will allow health professionals to remotely have an insight of the mental health of their patients and prevent possible relapse risks, which is essential for patients suffering from a chronic or mental pathology.
 
In this context, the objective of the CIFRE thesis is to **develop an automatic emotion recognition system**, based on signals from *visual, vocal* and *textual* modalities. This research work comes with its own challenges, notably with the fusion of heterogeneous and high dimensional data, as well as the management of contradictory information.
 
Other Jeolis Solutions projects will also benefit from the development of such a system, such as quality of work life monitoring and personalised physical activity coaching.
