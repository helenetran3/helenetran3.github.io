***Develop an automatic emotion recognition system, based on signals from visual, vocal and textual modalities***

### Application Cases 
*Jeolis Solutions* company projects that will benefit from the research work: 
- **Estimate the emotional state** from a video support to improve a patient monitoring software developed by the company. This is to help health professionals to remotely have an insight of their mental health and prevent possible relapse risks (which is essential for patients suffering from a chronic or mental pathology).
- **Adapting software content for a motivational purpose**: personalised physical activity coaching.
 
### Main Challenges
- Merge heterogeneous and high dimensional data
- Manage conflicting information
- Capture the ambiguity around emotion

### Tasks currently performed
- Literature review on emotion recognition models and emotion psychology
- Reflection on the application cases of the thesis
- Research paper writing
- Weekly meeting with the laboratory and the company teams
