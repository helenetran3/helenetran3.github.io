***The Four Agreements, for empowerment and a more peaceful life***

I am currently in the train from Paris to Clermont-Ferrand, after three weeks of holidays spent in different parts of France with my loved ones. More than four months have passed since I started my thesis in Clermont-Ferrand. While I was trying to take my marks in my new professional life, I went through difficult times in my personal life that urged me to refocus on myself and work on dysfunctional thoughts[^dys-thoughts] that I could have.

While I was engaged in a process of self-love and assertiveness, I discovered the Four Agreements. Based on Toltec wisdom, these incredibly simple agreements help us to free ourselves from limiting beliefs and have a more serene life. This book is probably one of those which have had the greatest impact on my life: it gives the tools for our own empowerment, which I try to apply everyday.


### Agreement 1: Be Impeccable With Your Words
Words are

### Agreement 2: Don't Take Anything Personally


### Agreement 3: Don't Make Assumptions


### Agreement 4: Always Do Your Best


### Conclusion and Reference

This post is intended to give a brief summary of each of these agreements. If I have succeeded in planting a fertile seed in someone's mind, then the mission of this post is accomplished. 

Want to understand more about these agreements? I strongly recommand you to read the book: <a class="post-tag" style="color:Blue" href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Agreements-Practical-Personal-Freedom/dp/1878424319 ">*The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom*, by Don Miguel Ruiz</a> (if you could buy it in a bookstore to support local shops, or read it in the library, that could be even better!). 

Enjoy your freedom! ☀️


### Footnotes

[^dys-thoughts]: In psychology, dysfunctional thoughts are those which give a biaised representation of the world. They are either **unrealistic** (disconnected from the reality) or **inadequate** (they do not serve one's interest). For example, "*My needs are not as important as others' needs.*" can be considered as inadequate, while "*Everyone is manipulating me.*" is unrealistic (and also inadequate).
